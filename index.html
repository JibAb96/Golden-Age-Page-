            <p><span>al-Khwarizmi</span> (also spelled al-Khwarizmi or al-Khwarizmiy) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who lived in the 9th century. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of mathematics and is considered the "father of algebra."       
            <br>
            The word "algorithm" is derived from the Latinized version of his name, "algorismus." Al-Khwarizmi's work laid the foundation for the development of modern algebra and his systematic approach to solving mathematical problems is considered the first example of an algorithm.

            <p><span>Galileo Galilei</span> was an Italian astronomer, mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries. He is considered to be one of the fathers of modern observational astronomy and a key figure in the Scientific Revolution.<br>Galileo made many important contributions to science and technology, including the development of the telescope, which allowed him to observe the night sky in greater detail than ever before.

            <p><span>Ibn al-Haytham</span> is widely considered as the father of optics for his pioneering work in the field of optics and his book "Kitab al-Manazir" (Book of Optics) is considered one of the most important works in the history of optics. 
               <br> Ibn al-Haytham's approach to scientific inquiry was an important precursor to the modern scientific method, which emphasizes the use of observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning to study natural phenomena.
