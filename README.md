## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colors I used are based on the hero image being brown and the name including golden. These colors include: #835c3b, #D3AC8B, #d4af37 and #F7F9F9.

### Typography
I used two google fonts that are considered a pair, which are:
<li>Raleway is used for headings to give a formal look</li>
<li>Bitter is used for the body text on the website as it pairs well with Raleway.</li> 

### Imagery
The images I use in the website are from different sources credited in the credits section.
## Features

### Navigation
The logo is featured at the top left hand side of the page. The color of the logo relates to the name of the web page. The Raleway font is used to make it look formal.

The navigation featured on the right hand side navigates to the landing page (Home), the historical figures (Figures) and the survey page (Survey). The brown color is used as it goes well with the hero image used.
